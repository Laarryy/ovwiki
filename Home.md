## **Where to Begin**

#### 1) :book: Wiki

**Please** make use of the resources available here on GitHub. The entire plugin has full documentation, and most things are covered and explained here.

#### 2) :speech_balloon: Make an Issue or Use Spigot

If you've tried looking through the wiki and still don't have an answer for your question, feel free to make an issue [here on GitHub](https://github.com/OmegaWeaponDev/OmegaVision/issues) or start a discussion [here on the Spigot page](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/omegavision.405434/).

## **Bugs and Feature Requests**
You can also [make an issue](https://github.com/OmegaWeaponDev/OmegaVision/issues) if you've found a bug and want to report it, or if you've got a feature request or suggestion for the plugin. Without you letting me know where the bugs are, it would be nearly impossible to find them, and without your suggestions the plugin would never get better. Thank you!
